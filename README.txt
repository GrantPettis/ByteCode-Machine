# ByteCode-Machine
This project is a implementation of the ByteCode_Machine using a combination of C and C++ based on the book _Crafting Inpertpreters_ by Robert Nystrom 


The BytecodeMachine bin contains all the relevant code and tests for this project.


The rest of the repo is all of the test cases broken down into different bins for what they are testing. Each bin will have all the tests and then a result file giving what the interpreter returned. For example a test will be named "testfile" and what it gives will be named "testfile_result"


The benchmark file contains more complicated tests. The rest are mainly individual unit tests


If you wish to test it. You may compile the code and use the command prompt to test. For a windows machine this is the path to use to test a file C:...\ByteCode Machine\x64\Debug>"ByteCode Machine.exe" "..\..\ByteCode Machine\assignment\associativity.lox"
